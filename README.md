i'm currently testing the codes in the file 
direct gen = direct_generation.py 
socratic gen = socratic_gen.py 
evaluation = evaluation.py



currently, test cases all failed, tried to put more 'personality' in the personas just now, but it didn't work well, tried another method but it didnt work too, so will revert to difining the persona more. currently with the test cases, socratic have minor improvements like 2-4% improvement after trying on leetcode problems. 

need to figure out why edge cases arent handled properly!!!!
