OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================
⚖️  BOTH METHODS ARE COMPARABLE for hard LeetCode problems
   Consider using Direct for speed, Socratic for critical code

KEY INSIGHTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Problems where Socratic excels: Complex algorithms with many edge cases
2. Problems where Direct excels: Straightforward implementations
3. Time trade-off: Socratic is typically 3-5x slower but may produce better code
4. For production code, consider Socratic method for critical components
5. For quick prototyping, Direct generation is more efficient
